                    <p class="card-text">"How did Colleen Hoover ever think up this dark and twisted tale? It is so unique, so 
                      completely shocking that it blows away every other suspense story I've ever read.</p>
                      <p>Lowen is a struggling writer when she gets an offer too good to pass up. Jeremy, the husband of successful 
                        author Verity Crawford, hires Lowen to complete Verity's series when his injured wife is unable to do so. 
                        Once Lowen arrives at their home to start compiling notes and do research, she discovers an unfinished 
                        manuscript that looks to be Verity's autobiography. What is written in those pages will horrify and haunt 
                        anyone who reads it." - Yun

                      damn highway doing 90 miles an hour (commonly referred to as a plot twist). Sweet Mother of Mercy!</p>
                     <p>There is not much to say without the risk of giving up some detail that’s best left secret. Soooo many times I 
                      wanted to just take one little peek at the end to see what happens to Nick and Amy. But I didn’t. I survived 
                      the heart pounding suspense and made it to the end of a very satisfying read." - Lisa B.</p>
